# Mending Mastery
> A Minecraft mod focused on exploration, spellcasting, and crafting.  

## Install
1. Get Minecraft **1.21.10** with **Fabric**.
2. Put the [.jar from releases](https://github.com/yaroslav-belozerov/crazymod/releases) and the [fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.138.4+1.21.10) in the mods directory.
3. Launch the game! The crafts are high end, so for now I don't recommend survival.

## Gameplay

1. Craft an infuser from resin, sculk sensor, and a nether star.
2. Infuse a stick with a diamond to get a magic wand.
3. Use the magic wand to cast spells.
